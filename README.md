# Manaco XSD Code Completion

This is a basic and low resource way to provide client-side code completion for the Monaco-editor. The XSD is based on the ibisdoc but could work with other XSD's in the future.

ToDo:

-   [x] Parse XSD
-   [x] Code completion based on XSD
-   [x] Cache code suggestions
-   [x] Autocomplete close tags
-   [x] Insert element als snippit (or tamplate)
-   [x] Auto indentation ([RP for Monaco-languages](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-languages/pull/113))
-   [ ] Implement namespaces
    -   [ ] Get suggestions from multiple XSD's
    -   [ ] Append namespace to suggestions
-   [ ] Template based on XSD
-   [ ] Show syntax errors
